This project was the final thesis paper for a course in media and culture I took in Spring 2013.

The course focused on the effect of emerging digital media technologies on both individuals and society, with a concentration on social media, participatory media, and local and global culture. The goal of the final thesis paper was to demonstrate a thorough understanding of society's consumption of digital media by researching, analyzing, and presenting a comprehensive commentary on any topic related to social issues with digital media.

As a former organizer of a [Harry Potter community](https://www.meetup.com/Potterdelphia/) and a speaker at an [international conference in 2007](http://softconference.com/hpef/sessionDetail.asp?SID=102045), I selected Harry Potter fandom as the topic for my thesis. From the paper's abstract:

> _Harry Potter_ fandom had taken the world by storm, and continues to grow even today, nearly six years after the release of seventh and final book, in part due to the influence of the internet and digital media. In the modern convergence culture, fans expect certain rights and permissions when interacting with the Harry Potter universe, but the original creators often have different expectations. Fan fiction and wizard rock are two forms of fan-made derivative works that have used the accessible nature of the internet to grow fandom, but are also not without their own issues.

The paper illustrated the rise of fandom based on the _Harry Potter_ book series, analyzed user-generated content in relation to the fandom, discussed wizard rock and fan fiction, and presented ethical issues regarding intellectual property and adult content in fan-made materials.
