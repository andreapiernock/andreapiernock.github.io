FacingBipolar was an unbranded website for AstraZeneca, aimed at providing extensive and reliable information to patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The project kicked off in summer 2008 with a diverse team, encompassing account, marketing, creative, and technology departments. As the lead front-end developer on the project, I collaborated with our technology lead on the basic front-end assets and code standards for the website, and with our senior back-end developer on the template framework. The website launched in early spring 2009.

FacingBipolar won [an award](http://advertisingcompetition.org/winner.asp?eid=13594) in 2009 for outstanding achievement in web development under the Pharmaceuticals category.

Development was done in Visual Studio using ASP.net. The back-end developer built the template framework, and I broke out our components into reusable blocks, such as header, footer, and callouts. The MooTools library imported minimal JavaScript functionality, and [sIFR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Inman_Flash_Replacement) provided custom fonts for page headlines.

One feature of the website was the inclusion of images designed to look like sticky notes and photos scattered across a desk. To accomplish this effect, the images were saved as high-quality PNG files that could support alpha-channel transparency, while HTMl and CSS was written to allow the pullquotes to be read in the regular flow of content while also appearing slightly disorganized.
