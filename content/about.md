My name is Reed, and I am a front-end web developer in Washington DC.

I graduated from a program in digital media and web technology, focused on the intersection of culture and technology. I am passionate about social issues regarding gender, sexuality, and reproductive rights. I am a feminist, a night-owl, a bike-and-bus commuter, and a vegan baker. I drink coffee while I code, I knit socks based on my fandoms, and I sing in a team-based social karaoke league.

In my current position, I am a senior front-end developer on the web team at Georgetown University, creating, coding, and maintaining Drupal and WordPress themes for the university websites, and collaborating with my team via Google, Trello, Github, and Slack. Our method is Agile, and I've expanded our process to include feature branching in Git, thorough code review, and comprehensive quality assurance. On many projects, I act as tech lead and direct our research, analysis, and architecture while coordinating with our product manager.

For several several years I've relied on [Compass](http://compass-style.org) for my CSS/Sass framework, but can easily switch to another Sass-based system like Bourbon. I prefer SMACSS over BEM, but I do appreciate how they can work together.

Although responsive and accessible HTML and CSS is my main code focus, I also work with JavaScript libraries and frameworks, such as jQuery and Bootstrap. I can work with middle-layer and back-end technologies, but I am not a full stack dev.

I hope upon all that is good in this world that we never go back to table-based layouts.
