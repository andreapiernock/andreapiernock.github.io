        <p>Most folks call me Ree. I am a front-end web developer in Washington, DC, who has a deep dedication to web standards and accessibility, and enjoys working in a motivating and challenging position that demands organization, creativity, and communication.</p>
        <p>Presently, I study digital media and web technology, focusing on the intersection of culture and technology, and am passionate about social issues regarding gender, sexuality, and reproductive rights.</p>
        <p>I am a feminist, a night-owl, a bike-and-bus commuter, and a vegan baker. I drink coffee while I code, I knit socks based on my fandoms, and I sing in a team-based social karaoke league.</p>
        <p>In my current position, I am a senior front-end developer on the web team at Georgetown University, creating, coding, and maintaining Drupal themes for the university websites, and collaborating with my team via Google, Trello, Github, and Slack.</p>
        <p>Previously, I have worked for digital agencies such as Digitas Health in Philadelphia, PA and Refinery, Inc in Hatboro, PA. My first full-time job as a developer was with the U.S. EPA office in Philadelphia. I've done some independent work for groups like Corey McPherson Nash but also for friends and small businesses.</p>
        <p>I hope upon all that is good in this world that we never go back to table-based layouts.</p>
